# Time-Sheet Management System (TMS)

## Introduction
This project aims to create a Time-Sheet Management System with features tailored for both employees and managers. Employees can log their work hours or leave days, view their time-sheet status, and sign up for the system. Managers have additional capabilities such as viewing time-sheet data and approving or rejecting time-sheets.
